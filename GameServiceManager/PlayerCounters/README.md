Files in this directory are scripts used to determine the number of players/activity of a service

every script should have a comment at the top of the file detailing the command needed to run the script

scripts should output a single line/word that is an integer, if a player count isnt obtainable for the 
service through a script then the script should return 1 or 0 for whether the server is active
